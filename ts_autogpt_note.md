Welcome back!  Would you like me to return to being my_autoGPT?
Continue with the last settings?
Name:  my_autoGPT
Role:  research and deploy a language model that is affotable to run and train on this computer
Goals: ['know the capability of this computer', 'know the computing power cost of possible models', 'test the model', 'resolve problem is encountered', 'try to optimize the performance']
Continue (y/n): n
Welcome to Auto-GPT!  Enter the name of your AI and its role below. Entering nothing will load defaults.
Name your AI:  For example, 'Entrepreneur-GPT'
AI Name: my_autoGPT
my_autoGPT here!  I am at your service.
Describe your AI's role:  For example, 'an AI designed to autonomously develop and run businesses with the sole goal of increasing your net worth.'
my_autoGPT is: an ai is designed to do research on language model
Enter up to 5 goals for your AI:  For example: Increase net worth, Grow Twitter Account, Develop and manage multiple businesses autonomously'
Enter nothing to load defaults, enter nothing when finished.
Goal 1: know the computing capability of this pc
Goal 2: search for language models that can be deployed and trained on this pc
Goal 3: build a list of language models that can be deployed and trained on this pc, save as markdown file
Goal 4: try to score the models, so i can have a idea of theier performance
Goal 5: download the model of highest score to pc
Using memory of type: LocalCache
MY_AUTOGPT THOUGHTS:  I need to determine the computing capability of this pc to know which language models can be deployed and trained on it. I can try
 checking the system information within the control panel
REASONING:  Checking the system information will give me detailed information about the PC
PLAN:
-  Use the execute_shell command to open the control panel
-  Navigate to the System Information window
-  Check for the processor type, memory, and available disk space
CRITICISM:  I need to be aware of the limitations of the system and avoid overloading it with tasks that it cannot handle.

NEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = execute_shell ARGUMENTS = {'command_line': 'control /name Microsoft.System'}
Enter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for my_autoGPT...
Input:y

SYSTEM:  Command execute_shell returned: You are not allowed to run local shell commands. To execute shell commands, EXECUTE_LOCAL_COMMANDS must be set to 'True' in your config. Do not attempt to bypass the restriction.
MY_AUTOGPT THOUGHTS:  I'm unable to run the execute_shell command to look at the system information in the control panel as directed by my previous plan. I can search for another way to obtain system information using the Google Search command
REASONING:  Searching on the internet can reveal alternative methods of obtaining system information when conventional paths are unavailable
PLAN:
-  Use the Google Search command to search for alternative ways to check the computing capability of this PC
-  Read and compile a list of these methods and limit it to those that can be executed with this PC
-  Save the list as a markdown file
CRITICISM:  I need to ensure that any method I find through the internet is reputable and secure before executing it. I should also keep in mind the limited computing resources of this PC.
